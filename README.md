# Thoughts.

A simple and elegant checklist app that helps you stay organized.\
This app is a proof of concept and not meant for production environments.\
Built with React.

## Features

Seamlessly add, edit and remove checklists that are stored using the localStorage interface.\
Also allows the user to change various preferences for the app's design.

## Demo
